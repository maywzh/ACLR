## Dataet Info

### Data Set Information:

This database has been artificially generated by using a first order theory which describes the structure of ten capital letters of the English alphabet and a random choice theorem prover which accounts for etherogeneity in the instances. The capital letters represented are the following: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, P, R. Each instance is structured and is described by a set of segments (lines) which resemble the way an automatic program would segment an image. Each instance is stored in a separate file whose format is the following:

```
CLASS OBJNUM TYPE XX1 YY1 XX2 YY2 SIZE DIAG
```
where CLASS is an integer number indicating the class as described below, OBJNUM is an integer identifier of a segment (starting from 0) in the instance and the remaining columns represent attribute values. For further details, contact the author.


### Attribute Information:

- **TYPE**: the first attribute describes the type of segment and is always set to the string "line". Its C language type is char.

- **XX1,YY1,XX2,YY2**: these attributes contain the initial and final coordinates of a segment in a cartesian plane. Their C language type is int.

- **SIZE**: this is the length of a segment computed by using the geometric distance between two points A(X1,Y1) and B(X2,Y2). Its C language type is float.

- **DIAG**: this is the length of the diagonal of the smallest rectangle which includes the picture of the character. The value of this attribute is the same in each object. Its C language type is float.
